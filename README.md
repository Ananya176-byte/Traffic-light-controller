# Traffic-light-controller
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project is a four-way traffic light controller designed and simulated using digital logic circuits. The system controls traffic signals at an intersection, ensuring smooth traffic flow by sequentially switching between red, yellow, and green lights for each direction. A 7-segment display is used to show a 3-second countdown for each signal phase, providing clear timing information to drivers.
